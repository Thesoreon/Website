# Website
Hi my name is Paul and this is my first project shared on github.
I have worked with bitbucket for few months, but it came the time to change it!

This is my project, that im using to learn basics of html, css, javascript, php and more.

My first experiences with websites languages were when i was fourteen.
I'm making a lot of projects. I'm trying to make games with Unity and C#. (about one year, started 2k16 October)
